/**
 * Contains test cases for verifying the functionality and correctness of the Package Cost Calculator application.
 *
 * <p>The {@code test} package is responsible for the following:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Unit Tests:</b> Ensures individual components, such as calculations and data handling, function as expected.</li>
 *   <li><b>Integration Tests:</b> Validates the interaction between multiple components, including GUI, control, and data layers.</li>
 *   <li><b>Edge Case Handling:</b> Tests the applicationâ€™s behavior with invalid, extreme, or unexpected inputs.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Key Classes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Test classes for {@code control} package (e.g., {@code CalculatorTest}, {@code ConfigHandlerTest}).</li>
 *   <li>Test classes for {@code data} package (e.g., {@code PacketTest}).</li>
 *   <li>Test classes for {@code gui} package (e.g., {@code PackageCalculatorUITest}).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package ensures the reliability and stability of the application through rigorous testing, 
 * adhering to best practices in test-driven development (TDD).</p>
