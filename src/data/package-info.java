/**
 * Contains classes that define the data structures used in the Package Cost Calculator application.
 *
 * <p>The {@code data} package is responsible for modeling the data entities required for calculations
 * and configuration management within the application. These classes serve as the core data models
 * exchanged between the GUI and control layers.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key Classes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link data.Packet} - Represents a package with attributes such as dimensions and weight, 
 *       used for shipping cost calculations.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package provides a clear separation of concerns by encapsulating data definitions, ensuring
 * that the business logic and GUI interact with well-defined data structures.</p>
